## Lab 2 - Document Clustering with Hadoop MapReduce

This lab aims to applying the k-means clustering algorithm on document datasets using Hadoop MapReduce. It consists of two parts: data preprocessing and algorithm implementation. Throughout this lab, we've learnt alot about developing a MapReduce program in Java, from simple program to much more complex like implementing KMeans algorithm. This lab also provide much knownledge about Linux enviroment, we've been much more familiar to commands and set up.
